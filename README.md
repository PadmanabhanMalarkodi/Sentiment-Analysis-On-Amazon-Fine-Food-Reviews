## Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa and VADER

### Intoduction
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. The goal is to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis has applications in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, product reviews, and more.

### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of RoBERTa and VADER models for sentiment analysis on textual data. The goal is to classify text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments based on their content.

### Tools used for this project:
* Python
* Google Colab (Notebook)
* NLTK
* Hugging Face
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

### Models Used:
**RoBERTa**: A state-of-the-art NLP model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

**VADER**: A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is particularly effective for social media texts.

### Project Structure
**notebooks/**: Contains the Jupyter notebook used for the analysis and implementation of the sentiment analysis models.
**data/**: Folder containing the dataset used for sentiment analysis.
**scripts/**: Python scripts used for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
**README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

### Results
The sentiment analysis results will provide the probability distribution over the sentiment classes (negative, neutral, positive) for each text sample.
